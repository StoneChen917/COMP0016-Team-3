Prompt Cambodian Red \\nCross response with the help of DREF funding helped mitigate the situation and \\nsave many lives. \\n \\n \\nCambodia: Dengue \\nfever outbreak  DREF Bulletin no. MDRKH001\\n25 January 2008\\nGLIDE number: EP-2007-000099-KHM\\n \\nThe International Federation’s Disaster Relief Emer gency Fund (DREF) is a source of un-earmarked \\nmoney created by the Federation in 1985 to ensure th at immediate financial support is available for Red \\nCross Red Crescent response to emergencies. The DRE F is a vital part of the International Federation’s \\ndisaster response system and incr eases the ability of national soci eties to respond to disasters.  \\nSummary: A DREF allocation of CHF \\n140,900 (USD 118,000  or EUR 86,000) was \\nmade in response to the needs of the tens of thousands at risk of dengue fever in \\nCambodia. The operation was implemented \\nover a period of just over three months from late July to October 2007. This operation is \\naligned with the International Federation's \\nGlobal Agenda Goal 2: Reduced deaths, illnesses and impact from diseases and public \\nhealth emergencies. \\n “Dengue is hitting almost all provinces \\nnationwide. We cannot contain the virus with \\nour limited resources; we need foreign help,” \\nsaid Ngan Chanta, head of Cambodia’s anti-\\ndengue programme in July 2007. The Cambodian Red Cros s’s (CRC) prompt \\naccess of DREF helped significantly in the \\ncountry’s response to a major outbreak.  \\n \\n <click here\\n for the final financial report, \\nor here  to view contact details>  \\n \\n \\n \\nThe situation \\nSince 1962, Cambodia has faced regular dengue fever outbreaks which affect children in areas with \\nconcentrated populations. Epidemics were reported in  1983, 1985, 1987 and 1990. Previously the most \\nsevere outbreak of dengue fever/dengue haemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) occurred in 1995 with more than \\n10,200 cases and 420 deaths, which corresponds to an attack rate of approximately 104 per 100,000 \\npopulation.1 \\n \\n                                                 \\n1 Abstract from Dengue Bulletin Volume 21, D ecember-1997, Status of Dengue Control in Ca mbodia  -  Dr. Ngan Chantha, PM for Deng ue, MoH \", ' 2 2007 has seen the highest number of conf irmed cases of DF/DHF since 1983. To date, the official number of \\nreported cases for 2007 has reached 38,531 with 397 deaths (Case Fatality Rate/CFR2 1.0)3.  Figures \\npeaked in July which coincided with the launch of the CRC’s nationwide campaign to combat DF/DHF.  \\nActivities were conducted in collaboration with the Mini stry of Health (MoH) with financial support from the \\nFederation’s DREF fund and locally raised funds from C RC. Activities included distribution of larvicide to \\nhouseholds, promotion of methods for preventing dengue,  printing and distribution of information, education \\nand communication (IEC) materials, and environmental clean-up campaigns.   \\nSome of the reasons cited (but not proven) for the high incidence rate for dengue in Cambodia and its \\nneighbouring counties include climate change, increa sed urbanization due to population movement coupled \\nwith a continued lack of knowledge and efforts to pr event dengue by the communi ty. Added to these was the \\ndelay in initiating response and launching a preventive operation before the outbreak.   \\n \\n \\nWeekly Report of Hospitalized Dengue Cases, Deaths and CFR, Cambodia 2007\\nas of week 41 (End Oct), 200743\\n145\\n174\\n160\\n135\\n132\\n101\\n74\\n119\\n134134\\n148\\n197\\n208\\n247\\n335\\n501\\n668\\n679\\n1050\\n1098\\n1559\\n2155\\n2671\\n2874\\n2627\\n2492\\n3135\\n2094\\n2544\\n1848\\n1878\\n1568\\n921\\n943\\n813\\n575\\n537\\n414\\n297\\n79\\n250.0 0.0 0.01.3\\n0.0 0.0 0.01.4\\n0.01.52.2\\n0.71.01.92.02.12.4\\n1.31.31.5\\n1.51.7\\n1.2\\n1.0\\n0.71.31.6\\n0.8\\n0.70.80.91.1\\n0.50.60.70.71.7\\n0.70.7\\n0.0 0.00.5\\n0500100015002000250030003500\\n123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 2 0 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 5 2 6 2 7 2 8 2 9 3 0 3 1 3 2 3 3 3 4 3 5 3 6 3 7 3 8 3 9 4 0 4 1 4 2\\nWeek of yearNumber of cases\\n00.511.522.53\\nCFR (%)Cases Deaths CFR\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRed Cross and Red Crescent action \\nIn coordination with the National and Provincial Mini stry of Health, the Cambodian Red Cross committed to \\nfive strategies: \\n \\n1. Nationwide campaign through its network of  Red Cross, Red Cross Volunteers and Youth \\n2. Integration of DHF into all Red Cross Acti vities from headquarters to community levels \\n3. Mass media: television and newspapers \\n4. Appeals; local and international, DREF via the Federation \\n5.

Hospital support provided \\n \\n• In response to the dengue epidemic, the President of the CRC launched a nationwide alert and appealed \\nto local businesses and the general public to support CRC efforts to assist in the national drive to combat dengue fever. There was a generous response and, as a result, the CRC headquarters was able to \\ndonate 6,120 bottles of serum to several hospitals including Phnom Penh municipality, National \\nPaediatric hospital, Preah Sihanouk Hospital, Kampo ng Speu, Kandal, and district-level hospitals.  \\n \\nSupport was also given to 1,615 families with childr en affected by dengue by providing food/non-food kits \\n(such as canned milk, instant noodles, canned soy milk, mosquito nets, blankets, and clothes) and a small amount of money. Red Cross branches in seve ral provinces also raised funds locally which enabled \\nthem to provide support to children affected by DF/DHF and the hospitals caring for them. Hospitals \\nsupported by the CRC included those mentioned previously: Phnom Penh municipality, National \\nPaediatric hospital, Preah Sihanouk Hospital, Kampong Sp eu, Kandal, and district-level hospitals. The \\nCRC Kampong Cham branch contributed the sum of  USD 10,000 (CHF 11,000 or EUR 6,843) to the \\nprovincial paediatric hospital for DF case treatment and management. \\n \\n• Cambodian Red Cross/French Red Cross gave USD 17,119 (CHF 18,815 or EUR 11,713) to the National \\nPaediatric hospital for staff support and case management \\n \\n2. Public appeal for voluntary blood donation  \\nDuring the DHF outbreak, the National Blood Transfusion Centre faced a severe shortage of safe blood and blood products for paediatric hospitals in Phnom Penh. In response to this crisis, the CRC appealed for voluntary blood donation from all government officers in  the city. This appeal resulted in the national blood \\nbank receiving a hundred units of blood to supply to paediatric hospitals.     \\n \\n3. Larvicide (Abate) distribution  \\nThe DREF funding enabled the CRC, with assistance from the Federation country delegation and regional \\nlogistics unit, to procure 35 tonnes of Abate, whic h arrived in Cambodia in mid-August. The CRC, in \\ncoordination with the MoH, distributed Abate in four of the worst affect ed provinces. Due to exchange rate \\ndifferences, the Abate cost less than expected. As a result, there is a balance of approximately CHF 3.950 \\nwhich has been returned to the DREF. Full details are shown in the accompanying financial report\\n.  \\n \\nSummary of Abate distribution to Red Cross branches \\n \\nUp to 1,136 Red Cross volunteers (RCV) throughout t he four provinces were prov ided with training on how \\nto safely distribute Abate to households. Traditional wa ter storage jars were targeted, as a recent study \\nconducted in Kandal province showed that  up to 80 per cent of households had the Aegypti mosquito \\nbreeding in such containers. Thes e containers are heavy, difficult to move and clean, and are abundant \\nacross Cambodia.4 \\n \\nHealth education activities accompani ed this activity, utilizing posters and leaflets purc hased using DREF \\nfunds.  \\n                                                 \\n4 Information provided by  Red Cross Volunteers participating in the clean-up campaign   Provinces Districts Communes Village Household Abate \\nprovided \\n(kg) Abate \\ndist  (kg) Remaining \\n(kg) \\n1 Kg.

Mass media  \\nThe CRC worked with the national media to raise public awareness of the issue. The Phnom Penh \\nMunicipality Red Cross branch liaised with a local television network to provide broadcasts on dengue prevention. The message called for ever yone from all sectors and levels of community to actively participate \\nin the outbreak intervention with t he theme of “No larvae, No tiger mo squitoes, No dengue”. The broadcasts \\nreached an audience estimated to be in the tens of thousands. \\n \\n 5. Public Awareness and Clean-up Campaigns \\nIn September, an additional 13 provinces were sele cted by the CRC to conduct clean-up campaigns \\nincluding awareness raising of the dangers of dengue, together with the Provincial Department of Health. \\n \\nThe CRC national headquarters provided USD 500 \\n(CHF 550 or EUR 342) to each provincial branch \\noffice to mobilize volunteer s. Some 1,040 volunteers \\ntook part in this campaign, each receiving a cap and \\nT-shirt, and some small refreshment, covered by the \\nsaid USD 500 contribution. During this campaign, the volunteers distributed 39,000 IEC materials \\nthroughout the 17 provinces. Also contributing to the \\nnational effort, the CRC/Da nish Red Cross-supported \\nCommunity-based Health Development Project \\nconducted dengue awareness campaigns in the 50 \\nvillages in three provinces and distributed a further 179 posters and 8,555 leaflets. \\n \\n WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP  Throughout the entire process, the CRC has worked \\nin close collaboration with the Ministry of Health and  the WHO at both central and provincial levels. Joint \\nplanning and implementation was conducted especially with regard to the distribution of Abate. \\n In addition, the CRC and the Federation have been invited by the MoH to form a \"task force\" to look at the \\nlong term strategy to reduce the risk of dengue fever. Ot her members of this task force are WHO, Ministry of \\nRural Development (MoRD - Department responsible for rural water supply), UNICEF and leading NGOs \\nworking in the field of household rainwater harvesting.  The task force will identify local prac tices currently employed by some ho useholds to prevent vector breeding \\nin household water storage jars (e.g. guppy fish, char coal, net covers) and will improve and encourage the \\nbest and most efficient practices as well as try to identify additional effective measures.  A communication \\nstrategy in which the CRC is involved will be developed to  support this programme and it is hoped that the \\nCRC will also be involved in a pilot study to trial-run some of these methods. \\n  FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITY FROM CRC HEADQUARTERS   \\nStaff from the national headquarters health departm ent conducted monitoring visits during the Abate \\ndistribution in the four Red Cross branches of, K andal, Banthey, Meanchey and Kampong Cham provinces \\nand Phnom Penh city. The team met with the sele cted groups and the wider community, and conducted \\nhousehold interviews to understand the general situat ion regarding dengue haemorrhagic fever outbreaks in \\nthose provinces.  \\n \\nThe team learned that communities received most of their information about dengue fever, its prevention and \\nthe character of the current disease prevalence fr om various sources including mass media, RCVs, and \\nvillage health volunteers as well as through IEC posters and leaflets.  \\n Many of the people in the community thought that the Abate distribution came very late this year and \\nsuggested that distribution would have been more effectiv e if conducted before the outbreak started.  On the \\nWheel of misfortune:  Red Cross volunteers help in \\nthe clean-up campaign.  5 other hand, the team also learnt of some misconcept ions about Abate; a few of villagers would not accept \\nhaving Abate put in their water jars because they were afraid that it would poison the water and affect their \\nhealth. Other households, however (i.e. villages in th e Kampong Cham and Kandal provinces), placed extra \\nwater jars around their houses hoping to receive extra Abat e as they expected to get more rain in the coming \\nweeks. \\n \\nMore than 390 people died as a result of dengue, the vast  majority of these being young children. Mostly this \\nwas due to late and/or inappropriate treatment; many private practitioners did not follow the DHF treatment \\nprotocol.  Despite the nationwide efforts of the MoH to encourage parents to bring their children for early and \\nfree treatment to the health centres, many delayed and/ or used traditional or home care methods. Reports \\nsuggest that many children died unnecessarily becaus e they were given too much intravenous fluid or \\nparacetamol. \\n \\nIn general, the observation was that  most villagers were very happy and appreciated RCV and village health \\nvolunteer activities in their communities and believe d that dengue cases would be reduced after the Abate \\ndistribution campaign.    \\n \\nConclusion and way forward \\n \\nIn summary, with funding support from Federation on top of the support generat ed locally, the Red Cross \\nbranches around the country were able to respond to \\nand play a significant role in the national campaign to \\ncombat this year’s outbreak of dengue fever.   \\n \\nThe national response was late and many important lessons have been learnt. As such, the MoH together \\nwith the MoRD, with support from the WHO and \\nUNICEF, will take the lead in developing a long-term strategy to both reduce the incidence of dengue and to \\nrespond more effectively to future outbreaks. The CRC \\nexpects to contribute towards the formation of this new strategy at both the national and provincial level.  \\n \\nExperience from this year\\'s outbreak has shown that in \\norder to mitigate the effects of dengue in the future, \\nthere will need to be: \\n \\n1. Consistent promotion of preventi on activities throughout the year with an increased focus just before and \\nduring the rainy season in order to bring about behavi our change at community level. These activities \\nare being approved by the MoH. \\n2. An approved \"plan of action\" that will allow for ea rly recognition and prompt response to future dengue \\nepidemics, led by the MoH, and with a strong an d confirmed commitment from their partners. \\n \\n \\nHow we work \\nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the  Code of Conduct for the \\nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations \\n(NGOs) in Disaster Relief  and is committed to the Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards \\nin Disaster Response (Sphere)  in delivering assistance to the most vulnerable. \\n \\nThe right ingredient: A Red Cross volunteer adds \\nAbate to a container.  6 The International Federation’s activities are \\naligned with its Global Agenda, which sets out four broad goals to meet the Federation\\'s mission to \"improve the lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of humanity\". Global Agenda Goals: \\n• Reduce the numbers of deaths, injuries and impact \\nfrom disasters. \\n• Reduce the number of d eaths, illnesses and impact \\nfrom diseases and public health emergencies. \\n• Increase local community, civil society and Red Cross  \\nRed Crescent capacity to address the most urgent \\nsituations of vulnerability. \\n• Reduce intolerance, discrimination and social \\nexclusion and promote  respect for diversity and human \\ndignity. \\nContact information  \\nFor further information:  \\n• In Phnom Penh: Men Neary S opheak, deputy secretary-general;  \\nemail:
