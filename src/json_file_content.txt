  ['In the beginning of October 2016, an upsurge of violence in the northern area of Myanmar’s Rakhine State led to mass displacement amongst the local population. The violence took place against a backdrop of decades of protracted tension and intercommunal violence between Rakhine and Muslim communities in Rakhine.The violence was sparked by a series of coordinated attacks on 9 October on border police stations in Maungdaw and Rathedaung townships, located in the northern area of Rakhine State. The attacks triggered an immediate response from security forces in Myanmar, which resulted in access to these areas being denied for humanitarian organizations and the media.This however was relaxed in mid – April 2017. An estimated 120,000 people from Maungdaw district affected by the communal violence fled their homes to either Bangladesh or other safer areas within northern and central areas of Rakhine state.\r',

 ["The drought response operation was initiated by IFRC in January 2011 as part of a scaled up Somalia Annual Country Plan 2011 to respond to the drought situation in Somaliland and Puntland. The funds secured in early January 2011 enabled International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) and Somali Red Crescent Society (SRCS) to kick start the operation in April 2011. However, the general food security situation in Somalia deteriorated in July 2011 which led the United Nations to declare famine in Southern Somalia. The increased hardship in Southern and Central Somalia coupled with increased insecurity forced many people to move Northward seeking refuge in Puntland and Somaliland. The severe drought situation and acute shortage of food and water prompted the IFRC/SRCS to launch an Emergency Appeal on 23 September 2011. By the end of April 2013, most of the objectives and activities of the Emergency Appeal had been achieved. This include procurement and distribution of Non-Food Items(NFIs), procurement of medical supplies, procurement of vehicles for the mobile health clinics, water sources rehabilitation, fuel subsidy to run boreholes, food rations for boarding schools and orphanages to keep children in school, livelihoods support to fishing communities and strengthening the National Society response capacity. IFRC Somalia Country Representation commissioned a final external evaluation which was undertaken in the month of May 2013. Recommendations from the exercise include; the need to develop a national water programme strategy and guidelines; water management capacity building of SRCS staff, development of a participatory NFI distribution strategy, community resilience interventions including primary health care interventions and development of a national health programme including mobile clinics. An estimated 4 million people, representing over half the Somali population, were considered in crisis nationwide. The severe drought impact in the South also affected the North East and North West parts of the country. Massive relief operations were mounted in the second half of 2011. Due to the collective efforts of the humanitarian community and donors, the situation subsided and by November 2011, three regions namely, Bay, Bakool and Lower Shabelle were downgraded from a famine situation to a humanitarian emergency. According to a study commissioned by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Somalia Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) published in May 2013, an estimated 258,000 people including 133,000 children under the age of 5 could have lost their lives as a result of the drought. By the end of 2012, the food security situation had improved significantly; however, according to the FAO FSNAU report dated February 2013, more than 1.05 million Somalis remain in need of food assistance and livelihoods support, majority of them in South and Central Somalia. Malnutrition rates in Somalia remain among the highest in the world, with 215,000 children under the age of five being acutely malnourished. According to the World Food Programme (WFP) March 2013 report, the Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rate among the internally displaced children has decreased from a devastating 45 percent eighteen months earlier and stood at around 16 percent. Among the urban poor in Mogadishu, the rate had decreased even further to 10 percent.\r",{"entities":[[4,11,"DISASTER"],[143,150,"DISASTER"],[164,174,"ADMIN_1"],[179,188,"ADMIN_1"],[503,509,"DISASTER"],[675,683,"ADMIN_1"],[688,699,"ADMIN_1"],[711,718,"DISASTER"],[739,765,"DISASTER"],[1967,1974,"DISASTER"],[2267,2270,"ADMIN_1"],[2272,2278,"ADMIN_1"],[2283,2297,"ADMIN_1"],[2321,2327,"DISASTER"],[3345,3354,"ADMIN_2"]]}],
 ["The EU-Turkey statement from 18 March 2016 would later significantly decrease migration flows through the Eastern Mediterranean and the Western Balkan route, however by no means abating the challenges posed by the crisis. According to the agreement, new arrivals from 21 March 2016 onwards would be held in administrative detention centres pending outcome of their asylum applications and migrants entering Greece would be returned to Turkey if they do not apply for asylum within 48 hours of arrival or if their claims are rejected. However, fewer than 2,000 have been returned between March 2016 and November 2017, according to the European Commission.3 By January 2017, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported more than 62,000 migrants were stranded in Greece, of which more than 10,000 were located on the Greek islands predominantly in reception and identification centres (RICs) and more than 47,000 on the mainland4. The nature of the humanitarian operation therefore changed going from a situation in which people needed assistance aimed at aiding their transit through Greece, to one where they became static and camp-based for a yet undetermined time. To manage the situation, the Greek government opened new migrant sites (more than 40 in total) in North Greece and around Athens. However, further questions were raised at the time, such as the disputable conditions of the majority of the sites (e.g. site infrastructure, WASH issues, conditions of living for the migrant population), coupled with unclear plans and timing regarding the enhancement of those 40 sites; as well as the transition process of the migrant population. While the Greek government continuously dedicated its efforts in improving site conditions, the majority remained inadequate. The overcrowding and sub-standard conditions of the sites, lengthiness of the asylum registration and processing, inter-ethnic clashes, growing distrust of the migrant population towards humanitarian agencies, coordination challenges as well as the increasing lack of tolerance from the host communities contributed to escalating security incidents. Such issues significantly undermined the humanitarian operations in delivering much needed services on the ground, but more importantly, posed severe physical, emotional and mental health risks to the migrant population and vulnerable population.\r",{"entities":[[757,779,"DISASTER"],[1311,1318,"ADMIN_2"],[1908,1928,"DISASTER"],[2124,2143,"DISASTER"]]}],
 ["Despite the effectiveness of this early warning and early action (EW/EA) initiative and the related activities carried out, flooding in many countries has been very severe due to the fact that the heavy precipitation came at the end of the rainy season often after two months of normal rainy to dry conditions. The location of these rains (in areas with poor urbanization planning) exacerbated an already difficult situation. Based on ongoing updated meteorological reports from the African Centre of Meteorological Application for Development (ACMAD) highlighting heavy precipitations, other countries were covered by the EW/EA appeal. Therefore, some 51 climate risk bulletins for the humanitarian community in West Africa have been disseminated to the National Societies (NS) within the zone as early warning for appropriate actions through the Disaster Management volunteers’ network comprising 93 members of RDRT, 240 members of NDRT and 600 members of CDRT (regional, national and community disaster response teams). 14 countries in West Africa experienced flooding (Senegal, Burkina Faso, Niger, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Mauritania, Sierra Leone, Benin, Gambia, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Togo and Guinea). Early responses conducted by National Societies and supported by the Zone office and other Movement partners (Spanish Red Cross and the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development (AECID), Danish and Finnish Red Cross) have been implemented to assist at least 738,664 most vulnerable people with non-food items stocks available in Dakar and Accra regional warehouses and transported to the countries. In terms of early recovery, some affected communities have been supported with agricultural tools, seeds, fishing nets and shelter kits to mitigate the impact of the disasters and restore their livelihoods and coping mechanisms. The West and Central Africa Zone has been systematically monitoring climate information on all timescales, linking information to action using the African Centre of Meteorological Application for Development (ACMAD) forecast for the 2009 flood season in West and Central Africa, the monthly updates and the short term forecast sent by the International Federation/WCAZ focal point based in ACMAD. The EW/EA framework was implemented using a variety of tools and different funding sources. The contingency stocks were constituted in 2008 through the EW/EA appeal with support from Participating National Societies (PNS) and standalone DREF of CHF 200,000 made available in early September 2009 which provided cash to cover the operational costs of the early response in terms of non-food items distribution, transport cost and operational costs related to NFIs distribution, health sensitization, hygiene promotion and other related costs. The annual appeal funds have been used to train National Disaster Response Teams (NDRT), Community based Disaster Response Teams (CDRT) and Regional Disaster Response Teams (RDRT) members that were extensively used during the early response to floods thanks to the regular support provided by the Department for International Development (DFID), Spanish Red Cross/AECID, Irish, Norwegian and Swedish Red Cross Societies. The severity of some of the flood disasters was attributed to the fact that the rains in many areas arrived at the end of the season (after two months of precipitation under normal conditions). Poor urbanization policies exacerbated the floods in many densely populated areas. The Early warning/Early action framework was implemented in Senegal, Burkina Faso, Niger, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Mauritania, Sierra Leone, Benin, Gambia, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Togo and Guinea based on short term forecasts. The regional approach allowed Disaster Management coordinators in WCAZ to allocate resources according to the needs and to move resources (NFIs and staff) from one country to another according to the context and community needs. Community participation and flexibility in resource management made available through the prepositioned contingency stocks and trained NDRT, RDRT and CDRT increased the effectiveness of early response activities. The Central African Republic (CAR), Senegal, and Burkina Faso were also supported for early response through WCAZ contingency stock based in Dakar, Accra and Yaoundé. These countries were covered by specific Emergency Appeals. The West and Central Africa Zone focused its support in providing support to affected communities in recovery mainly in Mauritania, Niger and Chad using OPEC funds. In Central Africa, no severe floods were reported. Appropriate contingency stocks were prepositioned in Yaoundé and in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The activities were carried out and the stock used for early response activities was partially replenished thanks to the cash and in-kind support from Movement partners including Danish and Finnish Red Cross and United Arab Emirates Red Crescent, and from OPEC and the Luxembourg government.\r",{"entities":[[124,132,"DISASTER"],[1063,1071,"DISASTER"],[1556,1561,"ADMIN_1"],[1566,1571,"ADMIN_1"],[2093,2098,"DISASTER"],[3038,3044,"DISASTER"],[3243,3258,"DISASTER"],[3452,3458,"DISASTER"],[4299,4304,"ADMIN_1"],[4306,4311,"ADMIN_1"],[4316,4324,"ADMIN_1"],[4572,4585,"DISASTER"],[4654,4661,"ADMIN_1"]]}],
 ["CHF 60,045 was allocated from the IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) on 17 February, 2012 to support the Congolese Red Cross National Society in delivering assistance to some 59,120 refugees from Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and about 40,000 host populations. As the National Society was preparing to round up response to a previous cholera outbreak affecting Brazzaville, Likouala, Sangha, Cuvette, Plateaux and Pool divisions in Republic of Congo (RoC), a new cholera outbreak occurred in Betou, a locality where about 59,000 DRC refugees are being assisted by Congolese Red Cross and IFRC since 2009. A total of 355 cases of cholera infection were recorded and 5 persons succumbed to the disease. To respond to the epidemic, the Congolese Red Cross (CRC) launched a DREF operation with support from the IFRC’s Central Africa Regional Representation (CARREP). With the DREF funds allocated, the National Society trained 60 volunteers and 10 ‘hygiene mothers.’ By end of operation the trained volunteers sensitized 45,131 people on how to prevent cholera, treat water at home and keep the household environment clean. In addition, 1,584 affected persons received bars of soap for personal hygiene and 6,000 litres of chlorine solution were distributed for purposes of disinfection and disposal of corpses. The DREF operation was part of a larger coordinated effort involving other actors. Médecins d’Afrique (MDA)and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) France provided curative care, while Agende d’Assistance pour le Rapatriement des Réfugiés au Congo (AARREC) disinfected 287 water wells tested and recommended for disinfection by the Red Cross. UNICEF also carried out sensitization and disinfection activities using agents that were trained by Red Cross staff in Betou. Reports from the operation indicated that the number of cases were at their highest at the beginning of March 2012 when more than 300 cases were reported in Likouala Division. A decrease was recorded by the end of the month with only 22 cases registered in Betou and managed at the Betou health centre. Significant progress was recorded by the end of the operation in May through to June 2012 when no new cases were registered. This was attributed to the continuous and sustained hygiene awareness and sensitization sessions by the trained Red Cross volunteers and related interventions by collaborating partners. Since June 2012, Red Cross volunteers and other partners in Betou continue to conduct epidemiological surveillance and cholera prevention sensitizations. A small unspent balance of CHF 61 will be returned to the DREF.

 ["Continuous heavy rains during November and December, 2010 had increased the water levels of Buna, Kiri, Prroi Thate and Drini rivers as well the water level of Shkodra Lake. Furthermore, the water level in three artificial lakes (Fierza, Koman and Vau i Dejes) on Drini River were also risen. This made the authorities to open the emergency dam gates and release the water to avoid further damages. The water flow released was approximately 3,500 cubic metres per second, while the operative capacity of the dam is 800 cubic metres per second. The consequences of releasing this quantity of water into the Shkodra Lake caused floods in a large area of Shkodra town and its surroundings. The Dajc, Oboti, Darragjati, Berdice, Ana Malit, Velipojë, Bushat,Gur i Zi Communes were totally surrounded by water. Water had reached 30% of Shkodra town, flooding the areas of Livadhe, Ajasem, Xhabije and Bahcallek and inundating houses, business establishments and gas stations. The main road to Shkodra town was flooded as well as Berdicës Arch, part of Shkodra-Tirana axis. The secondary road, up in the hills was used to reach Shkodra town.

After a severe rainy season in Ecuador due to the effects of La Niña weather phenomenon, the Ecuadorian Red Cross responded by providing immediate relief to the affected families, through the distribution of food parcels and hygiene kits, as well as by reducing dengue risks. Additionally, the National Society organized health workshops for volunteers and community members, together with fumigation and cleaning campaigns for the mosquito breeding grounds. The dengue-prevention campaign was supported by the communications department of the National Society, which created radio and television spots, as well as different printed materials, both for distribution and for publication in national newspapers. The operation was implemented in four months, and was completed by 20 July 2012. The Belgian Red Cross and government, and ECHO have replenished the DREF for the allocation made to this operation.

 ["A major flash flooding occurred on Monday, 20 February 2006, due to heavy rains that affected Ma’bar city, Dhamar governorate (100 Km from south Sana’a). Three people – two men and one child – were confirmed dead. According to the assessment report prepared by the Yemen Red Crescent Society (YRCS) Dhamar branch assessment team, the floods caused destruction of more than 13 houses and partial damage of more than 47 homes, while 772 suffered minor wall cracks. In addition, about 53 goats/sheep and more than 2,000 chicken were lost. Vast area of fertile farming land was submerged in flood water. YRCS staff and volunteers helped Civil Defence personnel to evacuate 265 persons trapped in villages in Ma’bar region, which has a population of around 24,700 people. Some 502 people, mostly from the marginalized groups, were temporarily housed in a government school till a camp had been constructed in the outskirt of Ma’bar. About 90 more people took refuge in another temporary shelter gathering place near a local market. Another floods disaster followed just a few days after the first one. Starting at an early hour of Saturday morning, 25 February, torrential rains continued for over six hours in Lahj Governorate in the southern part of Yemen. The disaster was remarkably evident in the two districts of Alhotah and Tuban. Alhootah city, the capital of Lahj governorate, located about 30 kilometres northwest of Aden city, was the most affected area. Wahidah, Masjid Aldolah, and Alduba, three poor residential neighborhoods, witnessed greater devastation than other places in the city. That was attributed to poverty, lack of proper infrastructure and housing planning. Most houses are weakly constructed on lower lands and in some cases right on the streams of the flowing rain waters. The situation was worsened by limitation of the old drainage system that was built during the Sultanate eras. The drainpipes capacity could not cope with the amount of waters in the submerged streets resulting in slow collapse of houses, mainly built in mud. Evacuees had been temporarily accommodated in two nearby schools, and then moved to a more sustainable camp.\r",{"entities":[[8,22,"DISASTER"],[68,79,"DISASTER"],[107,125,"ADMIN_1"],[145,151,"ADMIN_1"],[334,340,"DISASTER"],[348,382,"DISASTER"],[549,599,"DISASTER"],[673,717,"DISASTER"],[1035,1050,"DISASTER"],[1206,1222,"ADMIN_1"],[1314,1321,"ADMIN_2"],[1326,1332,"ADMIN_2"],[1363,1379,"ADMIN_1"],[2016,2034,"DISASTER"]]}],
 ["Melting snow and heavy rains in February and March 2006 caused flooding in at least fourteen municipalities across Kosovo. The increased water levels in the rivers broke the banks/dams and flooded the surrounding areas. The flooding caused damage to houses and personal belongings, agricultural land and equipment, and the power system. Some villages in the rural and poorer part of the province were inaccessible for several days. An estimated 200 families (approx. 1,200 people) had to be evacuated from the affected areas and sheltered in neighbouring villages. The flooding was worst in the rural areas where the social problems of the province are affecting the highest number of people - a fragile economy, high unemployment, and a wide spectrum of social groups in need of special assistance are just some of the pressing issues for Kosovo’s institutions. With about 10% of the resident population receiving the low social assistance benefits and many more families not eligible for such assistance due to highly restrictive criteria, the needs in the social sector are extremely high. These flooding thus had a further deteriorating effect on the social situation of the province as the majority of affected people already belong to the poorest of the province who were not in a position to cope with the situation on their own.
