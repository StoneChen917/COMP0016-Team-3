  ['In the beginning of October 2016, an upsurge of violence in the northern area of Myanmar’s Rakhine State led to mass displacement amongst the local population. The violence took place against a backdrop of decades of protracted tension and intercommunal violence between Rakhine and Muslim communities in Rakhine.The violence was sparked by a series of coordinated attacks on 9 October on border police stations in Maungdaw and Rathedaung townships, located in the northern area of Rakhine State. The attacks triggered an immediate response from security forces in Myanmar, which resulted in access to these areas being denied for humanitarian organizations and the media.This however was relaxed in mid – April 2017. An estimated 120,000 people from Maungdaw district affected by the communal violence fled their homes to either Bangladesh or other safer areas within northern and central areas of Rakhine state.\r',

 ["The drought response operation was initiated by IFRC in January 2011 as part of a scaled up Somalia Annual Country Plan 2011 to respond to the drought situation in Somaliland and Puntland. The funds secured in early January 2011 enabled International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) and Somali Red Crescent Society (SRCS) to kick start the operation in April 2011. However, the general food security situation in Somalia deteriorated in July 2011 which led the United Nations to declare famine in Southern Somalia. The increased hardship in Southern and Central Somalia coupled with increased insecurity forced many people to move Northward seeking refuge in Puntland and Somaliland. The severe drought situation and acute shortage of food and water prompted the IFRC/SRCS to launch an Emergency Appeal on 23 September 2011. By the end of April 2013, most of the objectives and activities of the Emergency Appeal had been achieved. This include procurement and distribution of Non-Food Items(NFIs), procurement of medical supplies, procurement of vehicles for the mobile health clinics, water sources rehabilitation, fuel subsidy to run boreholes, food rations for boarding schools and orphanages to keep children in school, livelihoods support to fishing communities and strengthening the National Society response capacity. IFRC Somalia Country Representation commissioned a final external evaluation which was undertaken in the month of May 2013. Recommendations from the exercise include; the need to develop a national water programme strategy and guidelines; water management capacity building of SRCS staff, development of a participatory NFI distribution strategy, community resilience interventions including primary health care interventions and development of a national health programme including mobile clinics. An estimated 4 million people, representing over half the Somali population, were considered in crisis nationwide. The severe drought impact in the South also affected the North East and North West parts of the country. Massive relief operations were mounted in the second half of 2011. Due to the collective efforts of the humanitarian community and donors, the situation subsided and by November 2011, three regions namely, Bay, Bakool and Lower Shabelle were downgraded from a famine situation to a humanitarian emergency. According to a study commissioned by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Somalia Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) published in May 2013, an estimated 258,000 people including 133,000 children under the age of 5 could have lost their lives as a result of the drought. By the end of 2012, the food security situation had improved significantly; however, according to the FAO FSNAU report dated February 2013, more than 1.05 million Somalis remain in need of food assistance and livelihoods support, majority of them in South and Central Somalia. Malnutrition rates in Somalia remain among the highest in the world, with 215,000 children under the age of five being acutely malnourished. According to the World Food Programme (WFP) March 2013 report, the Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rate among the internally displaced children has decreased from a devastating 45 percent eighteen months earlier and stood at around 16 percent. Among the urban poor in Mogadishu, the rate had decreased even further to 10 percent.\r",{"entities":[[4,11,"DISASTER"],[143,150,"DISASTER"],[164,174,"ADMIN_1"],[179,188,"ADMIN_1"],[503,509,"DISASTER"],[675,683,"ADMIN_1"],[688,699,"ADMIN_1"],[711,718,"DISASTER"],[739,765,"DISASTER"],[1967,1974,"DISASTER"],[2267,2270,"ADMIN_1"],[2272,2278,"ADMIN_1"],[2283,2297,"ADMIN_1"],[2321,2327,"DISASTER"],[3345,3354,"ADMIN_2"]]}],
 ["The EU-Turkey statement from 18 March 2016 would later significantly decrease migration flows through the Eastern Mediterranean and the Western Balkan route, however by no means abating the challenges posed by the crisis. According to the agreement, new arrivals from 21 March 2016 onwards would be held in administrative detention centres pending outcome of their asylum applications and migrants entering Greece would be returned to Turkey if they do not apply for asylum within 48 hours of arrival or if their claims are rejected. However, fewer than 2,000 have been returned between March 2016 and November 2017, according to the European Commission.3 By January 2017, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported more than 62,000 migrants were stranded in Greece, of which more than 10,000 were located on the Greek islands predominantly in reception and identification centres (RICs) and more than 47,000 on the mainland4. The nature of the humanitarian operation therefore changed going from a situation in which people needed assistance aimed at aiding their transit through Greece, to one where they became static and camp-based for a yet undetermined time. To manage the situation, the Greek government opened new migrant sites (more than 40 in total) in North Greece and around Athens. However, further questions were raised at the time, such as the disputable conditions of the majority of the sites (e.g. site infrastructure, WASH issues, conditions of living for the migrant population), coupled with unclear plans and timing regarding the enhancement of those 40 sites; as well as the transition process of the migrant population. While the Greek government continuously dedicated its efforts in improving site conditions, the majority remained inadequate. The overcrowding and sub-standard conditions of the sites, lengthiness of the asylum registration and processing, inter-ethnic clashes, growing distrust of the migrant population towards humanitarian agencies, coordination challenges as well as the increasing lack of tolerance from the host communities contributed to escalating security incidents. Such issues significantly undermined the humanitarian operations in delivering much needed services on the ground, but more importantly, posed severe physical, emotional and mental health risks to the migrant population and vulnerable population.\r",{"entities":[[757,779,"DISASTER"],[1311,1318,"ADMIN_2"],[1908,1928,"DISASTER"],[2124,2143,"DISASTER"]]}],
 ["Despite the effectiveness of this early warning and early action (EW/EA) initiative and the related activities carried out, flooding in many countries has been very severe due to the fact that the heavy precipitation came at the end of the rainy season often after two months of normal rainy to dry conditions. The location of these rains (in areas with poor urbanization planning) exacerbated an already difficult situation. Based on ongoing updated meteorological reports from the African Centre of Meteorological Application for Development (ACMAD) highlighting heavy precipitations, other countries were covered by the EW/EA appeal. Therefore, some 51 climate risk bulletins for the humanitarian community in West Africa have been disseminated to the National Societies (NS) within the zone as early warning for appropriate actions through the Disaster Management volunteers’ network comprising 93 members of RDRT, 240 members of NDRT and 600 members of CDRT (regional, national and community disaster response teams). 14 countries in West Africa experienced flooding (Senegal, Burkina Faso, Niger, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Mauritania, Sierra Leone, Benin, Gambia, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Togo and Guinea). Early responses conducted by National Societies and supported by the Zone office and other Movement partners (Spanish Red Cross and the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development (AECID), Danish and Finnish Red Cross) have been implemented to assist at least 738,664 most vulnerable people with non-food items stocks available in Dakar and Accra regional warehouses and transported to the countries. In terms of early recovery, some affected communities have been supported with agricultural tools, seeds, fishing nets and shelter kits to mitigate the impact of the disasters and restore their livelihoods and coping mechanisms. The West and Central Africa Zone has been systematically monitoring climate information on all timescales, linking information to action using the African Centre of Meteorological Application for Development (ACMAD) forecast for the 2009 flood season in West and Central Africa, the monthly updates and the short term forecast sent by the International Federation/WCAZ focal point based in ACMAD. The EW/EA framework was implemented using a variety of tools and different funding sources. The contingency stocks were constituted in 2008 through the EW/EA appeal with support from Participating National Societies (PNS) and standalone DREF of CHF 200,000 made available in early September 2009 which provided cash to cover the operational costs of the early response in terms of non-food items distribution, transport cost and operational costs related to NFIs distribution, health sensitization, hygiene promotion and other related costs. The annual appeal funds have been used to train National Disaster Response Teams (NDRT), Community based Disaster Response Teams (CDRT) and Regional Disaster Response Teams (RDRT) members that were extensively used during the early response to floods thanks to the regular support provided by the Department for International Development (DFID), Spanish Red Cross/AECID, Irish, Norwegian and Swedish Red Cross Societies. The severity of some of the flood disasters was attributed to the fact that the rains in many areas arrived at the end of the season (after two months of precipitation under normal conditions). Poor urbanization policies exacerbated the floods in many densely populated areas. The Early warning/Early action framework was implemented in Senegal, Burkina Faso, Niger, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Mauritania, Sierra Leone, Benin, Gambia, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Togo and Guinea based on short term forecasts. The regional approach allowed Disaster Management coordinators in WCAZ to allocate resources according to the needs and to move resources (NFIs and staff) from one country to another according to the context and community needs. Community participation and flexibility in resource management made available through the prepositioned contingency stocks and trained NDRT, RDRT and CDRT increased the effectiveness of early response activities. The Central African Republic (CAR), Senegal, and Burkina Faso were also supported for early response through WCAZ contingency stock based in Dakar, Accra and Yaoundé. These countries were covered by specific Emergency Appeals. The West and Central Africa Zone focused its support in providing support to affected communities in recovery mainly in Mauritania, Niger and Chad using OPEC funds. In Central Africa, no severe floods were reported. Appropriate contingency stocks were prepositioned in Yaoundé and in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The activities were carried out and the stock used for early response activities was partially replenished thanks to the cash and in-kind support from Movement partners including Danish and Finnish Red Cross and United Arab Emirates Red Crescent, and from OPEC and the Luxembourg government.\r",{"entities":[[124,132,"DISASTER"],[1063,1071,"DISASTER"],[1556,1561,"ADMIN_1"],[1566,1571,"ADMIN_1"],[2093,2098,"DISASTER"],[3038,3044,"DISASTER"],[3243,3258,"DISASTER"],[3452,3458,"DISASTER"],[4299,4304,"ADMIN_1"],[4306,4311,"ADMIN_1"],[4316,4324,"ADMIN_1"],[4572,4585,"DISASTER"],[4654,4661,"ADMIN_1"]]}],
 ["CHF 60,045 was allocated from the IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) on 17 February, 2012 to support the Congolese Red Cross National Society in delivering assistance to some 59,120 refugees from Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and about 40,000 host populations. As the National Society was preparing to round up response to a previous cholera outbreak affecting Brazzaville, Likouala, Sangha, Cuvette, Plateaux and Pool divisions in Republic of Congo (RoC), a new cholera outbreak occurred in Betou, a locality where about 59,000 DRC refugees are being assisted by Congolese Red Cross and IFRC since 2009. A total of 355 cases of cholera infection were recorded and 5 persons succumbed to the disease. To respond to the epidemic, the Congolese Red Cross (CRC) launched a DREF operation with support from the IFRC’s Central Africa Regional Representation (CARREP). With the DREF funds allocated, the National Society trained 60 volunteers and 10 ‘hygiene mothers.’ By end of operation the trained volunteers sensitized 45,131 people on how to prevent cholera, treat water at home and keep the household environment clean. In addition, 1,584 affected persons received bars of soap for personal hygiene and 6,000 litres of chlorine solution were distributed for purposes of disinfection and disposal of corpses. The DREF operation was part of a larger coordinated effort involving other actors. Médecins d’Afrique (MDA)and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) France provided curative care, while Agende d’Assistance pour le Rapatriement des Réfugiés au Congo (AARREC) disinfected 287 water wells tested and recommended for disinfection by the Red Cross. UNICEF also carried out sensitization and disinfection activities using agents that were trained by Red Cross staff in Betou. Reports from the operation indicated that the number of cases were at their highest at the beginning of March 2012 when more than 300 cases were reported in Likouala Division. A decrease was recorded by the end of the month with only 22 cases registered in Betou and managed at the Betou health centre. Significant progress was recorded by the end of the operation in May through to June 2012 when no new cases were registered. This was attributed to the continuous and sustained hygiene awareness and sensitization sessions by the trained Red Cross volunteers and related interventions by collaborating partners. Since June 2012, Red Cross volunteers and other partners in Betou continue to conduct epidemiological surveillance and cholera prevention sensitizations. A small unspent balance of CHF 61 will be returned to the DREF.

 ["Continuous heavy rains during November and December, 2010 had increased the water levels of Buna, Kiri, Prroi Thate and Drini rivers as well the water level of Shkodra Lake. Furthermore, the water level in three artificial lakes (Fierza, Koman and Vau i Dejes) on Drini River were also risen. This made the authorities to open the emergency dam gates and release the water to avoid further damages. The water flow released was approximately 3,500 cubic metres per second, while the operative capacity of the dam is 800 cubic metres per second. The consequences of releasing this quantity of water into the Shkodra Lake caused floods in a large area of Shkodra town and its surroundings. The Dajc, Oboti, Darragjati, Berdice, Ana Malit, Velipojë, Bushat,Gur i Zi Communes were totally surrounded by water. Water had reached 30% of Shkodra town, flooding the areas of Livadhe, Ajasem, Xhabije and Bahcallek and inundating houses, business establishments and gas stations. The main road to Shkodra town was flooded as well as Berdicës Arch, part of Shkodra-Tirana axis. The secondary road, up in the hills was used to reach Shkodra town.

After a severe rainy season in Ecuador due to the effects of La Niña weather phenomenon, the Ecuadorian Red Cross responded by providing immediate relief to the affected families, through the distribution of food parcels and hygiene kits, as well as by reducing dengue risks. Additionally, the National Society organized health workshops for volunteers and community members, together with fumigation and cleaning campaigns for the mosquito breeding grounds. The dengue-prevention campaign was supported by the communications department of the National Society, which created radio and television spots, as well as different printed materials, both for distribution and for publication in national newspapers. The operation was implemented in four months, and was completed by 20 July 2012. The Belgian Red Cross and government, and ECHO have replenished the DREF for the allocation made to this operation.

 ["A major flash flooding occurred on Monday, 20 February 2006, due to heavy rains that affected Ma’bar city, Dhamar governorate (100 Km from south Sana’a). Three people – two men and one child – were confirmed dead. According to the assessment report prepared by the Yemen Red Crescent Society (YRCS) Dhamar branch assessment team, the floods caused destruction of more than 13 houses and partial damage of more than 47 homes, while 772 suffered minor wall cracks. In addition, about 53 goats/sheep and more than 2,000 chicken were lost. Vast area of fertile farming land was submerged in flood water. YRCS staff and volunteers helped Civil Defence personnel to evacuate 265 persons trapped in villages in Ma’bar region, which has a population of around 24,700 people. Some 502 people, mostly from the marginalized groups, were temporarily housed in a government school till a camp had been constructed in the outskirt of Ma’bar. About 90 more people took refuge in another temporary shelter gathering place near a local market. Another floods disaster followed just a few days after the first one. Starting at an early hour of Saturday morning, 25 February, torrential rains continued for over six hours in Lahj Governorate in the southern part of Yemen. The disaster was remarkably evident in the two districts of Alhotah and Tuban. Alhootah city, the capital of Lahj governorate, located about 30 kilometres northwest of Aden city, was the most affected area. Wahidah, Masjid Aldolah, and Alduba, three poor residential neighborhoods, witnessed greater devastation than other places in the city. That was attributed to poverty, lack of proper infrastructure and housing planning. Most houses are weakly constructed on lower lands and in some cases right on the streams of the flowing rain waters. The situation was worsened by limitation of the old drainage system that was built during the Sultanate eras. The drainpipes capacity could not cope with the amount of waters in the submerged streets resulting in slow collapse of houses, mainly built in mud. Evacuees had been temporarily accommodated in two nearby schools, and then moved to a more sustainable camp.\r",{"entities":[[8,22,"DISASTER"],[68,79,"DISASTER"],[107,125,"ADMIN_1"],[145,151,"ADMIN_1"],[334,340,"DISASTER"],[348,382,"DISASTER"],[549,599,"DISASTER"],[673,717,"DISASTER"],[1035,1050,"DISASTER"],[1206,1222,"ADMIN_1"],[1314,1321,"ADMIN_2"],[1326,1332,"ADMIN_2"],[1363,1379,"ADMIN_1"],[2016,2034,"DISASTER"]]}],
 ["Melting snow and heavy rains in February and March 2006 caused flooding in at least fourteen municipalities across Kosovo. The increased water levels in the rivers broke the banks/dams and flooded the surrounding areas. The flooding caused damage to houses and personal belongings, agricultural land and equipment, and the power system. Some villages in the rural and poorer part of the province were inaccessible for several days. An estimated 200 families (approx. 1,200 people) had to be evacuated from the affected areas and sheltered in neighbouring villages. The flooding was worst in the rural areas where the social problems of the province are affecting the highest number of people - a fragile economy, high unemployment, and a wide spectrum of social groups in need of special assistance are just some of the pressing issues for Kosovo’s institutions. With about 10% of the resident population receiving the low social assistance benefits and many more families not eligible for such assistance due to highly restrictive criteria, the needs in the social sector are extremely high. These flooding thus had a further deteriorating effect on the social situation of the province as the majority of affected people already belong to the poorest of the province who were not in a position to cope with the situation on their own.

 ["In the months of December 2005 and January 2006, Malawi experienced heavy rains which caused flooding in the lower Shire valley, central region as well as the northern region. The flooding affected 37,431 households in the following districts: Nsanje, Chikwawa (lower Shire), Mangochi and Machinga (southern region), Ntcheu (central region) and Nkhatabay (northern region). A total of 1,794 houses were destroyed and the displaced people sought shelter in schools or at homes of relatives living in upland areas which were not affected by the floods. Most of the destroyed houses were made from poor local materials such as wooden poles and mud. During the same period, Blantyre, Mangochi, Chikwawa and Nsanje districts in the southern region were affected by a cholera outbreak. A total of 852 cholera cases and 20 deaths were reported and confirmed by the Ministry of Health (MoH). These figures could be higher because some cases in remote areas were not reported. Following the floods, the Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) conducted an assessment of the damage caused in the affected areas. The findings indicated that there was need for shelter, water supply and sanitation interventions in all the flooded districts.

 ["Areas prone to flooding for Malaysia are approximately 29,800 square kilometres or nine per cent of the land area of the country. Large floods usually occur in the northern states of Malaysia due to prolonged rainfall, especially in the convening months of November and December. Johor, Pahang, Kelantan, Terengganu, and Sabah are affected, and flooding occurs annually. Significant heavy rains, which began on 2 January 2021, caused flooding in the five states in Peninsular Malaysia on the morning of 4 January. National Disaster Management Administration (NADMA) estimated that 11,973 families were affected by the floods including 8 deaths. A total of 42,947 people were evacuated to 397 evacuation centres in 27 districts within the five states. On 8 January 2021, The Malaysian Meteorological Department (Met Malaysia) issued a weather warning alert with expected continuous heavy rain to occur over the states of Terengganu, Pahang, Johor and Sarawak. It was reported that heavy rain and thunderstorms were to continue to hit Sarawak and Sabah until January 19. Continues heavy rain resulted in floods in Terengganu, Kelantan, and Sabah. There were reported damages of roads and landslides as well as minor damages to houses in the recent floods in those floods affected states. The MRCS along with the IFRC Asia Pacific regional office (APRO) closely monitored the situation and coordinated the response with the Government of Malaysia (GoM) through respective National and state Civil Defence Force (Flood Response Taskforce) at national and district levels. MRCS volunteers in branches throughout the affected areas were activated since 22 November 2020 and throughout the operation. The MRCS branches of Johor, Pahang, Kelantan and Terengganu had activated their annual floods preparedness plan in anticipation of the monsoon season. MRCS mobilized its local branch network to work alongside the authorities in addressing community needs. The flood emergency response operation was successfully executed benefiting recipients affected by flood in five states, namely Johor, Pahang, Sabah, Kelantan and Terengganu. During the implementation of this operation, MRCS followed the existing government and movement guidance related to the COVID-19 crisis. During the MCO, MRCS staff and volunteers were still allowed to operate as usual, considering that MRCS were providing essential services to people.

 ["Tanzania witnessed an increased level of flooding events in 2020 with over nine (9) of its regions affected and thousands of families displaced, property destroyed, livelihoods and lives lost. TRCS capacity to respond to these flooding events was particularly challenged requiring the National Society (NS) to rely on external support including that of the IFRC Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF). This report accounts for the DREF support to five regions; Kilimanjaro, Kagera, Katavi, Mara and Rukwa after flooding that occurred between 22 and 26 April 2020. The flooding resulted in loss of livelihoods, houses, and serious infrastructural damage. Destruction of roads and bridges hampered the speed with which assessments could be conducted. Local Government Authorities (LGAs) provided boats to support household items (HHIs) distributions in areas where TRCS trucks could not access. This also ensured affected families were not exposed to long walks to go receive their HHIs. The flooding occurred at a time when the NS was responding to COVID-19 pandemic and was also implementing another flood DREF operation in Lindi region, south east of the country. The DREF operation was granted in two phases with the first grant done on 8 May, for a total of 196,796 CHF to support 10,540 people (2,108 households) affected by the floods in Kilimanjaro, Kagera, Katavi, Mara and Rukwa.

 ["n 27 June 2019 a hailstorm has damaged almost all yield capacity of 14 communities in Shirak region in Armenia. This storm was already the third to hit Armenia within a month. According to results of the rapid assessment conducted by the Armenian Red Cross Society (ARCS) and Shirak regional authorities, 14 communities and about 3,900 households have been affected. 960 households in the four most affected communities have lost 80 to 100 per cent of their yield capacity. Therefore, these four most affected communities were selected to be targeted by the DREF operation. Based on the information provided by local authorities, the Armenian Red Cross Society together with its Shirak Regional branch conducted several meetings with regional authorities and has organized needs assessment in communities which have been most affected. After meeting with regional government representatives and presenting ARCS’s initiative, ARCS developed the criteria for the selection of people to work with in affected communities. Afterwards, the ARCS assessment team conducted an additional meeting with local authorities from the affected communities, and presented the selection criteria, based on which authorities were assigned to prepare a list of affected people/ families. The hailstorm caused extensive damage to a large number of households across the region. The Disaster Response Team (DRT) assigned by the ARCS met with Shirak Region (Marz) authorities to receive a detailed overview and analysis of the situation. Based on the data available from official sources and ARCS’ Shirak regional team, ARCS’ DRT together with regional government representatives selected six most affected communities where the yield capacity was damaged between 75% and100% (see map in Annex 1) as targets of the operation. A meeting was held with the heads of the communities to discuss the response approach and present selection criteria for provision of support from the Red Cross.

 ["Presidential voting in Nigeria started on February 23, 2019 after a one-week delay. This was due to the postponement by the Independent Electoral Commission due to logistical and operational concerns that needed to be rectified. There were 91 registered political parties and 63 candidates declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that contested for the presidential seat. The sitting President was re-elected by over 15 million votes. The governorship election was also delayed by one week and took place on March 9, 2019. Election campaigns commenced in December 2018 across the country. Throughout that month, unrest was observed, with incidences of hate speech, a reported death in Kogi, three deaths in Lagos and an attempted assassination of a candidate for governor in Ogun State. As a result of the assassination attempt, a police officer was shot and wounded. Election campaign billboards were also destroyed in Enugu, Niger, and Kogi. Since the independence, every election in Nigeria has experienced some level of violence, however, the level and intensity of the violence varied between years and states. A key learning from the experience of the 2015 elections was that violence has the potential to be more widespread than anticipated and that the quality of a response would be negatively impacted by any corresponding funding constraints. As a result, this year’s response plan increased the number of targeted divisions from five to six. Due to the recurrence of election violence and the projection of two million people being at at-risk, the preparedness level of Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS) was increased to improve its ability to provide humanitarian assistance in the event of violence. In preparation for the response, NRCS developed an Elections violence contingency plan in 2018 with the financial support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The objective of the Contingency Plan was to enhance NRCS`s preparedness capacity to respond to the most likely and worst-case scenarios in the identified 26 medium to high risk states. In the event there is reported widespread election violence, the contingency plan would trigger interventions related to health, water sanitation and hygiene, RFL, protection, psychosocial support, food and non-food needs.

 ["The extremely active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was an above-normal season, according to the NOAA National Hurricane Center (NHC)1. In total, the 2020 season produced 30 named storms (top winds of 39 mph or greater), of which 14 became hurricanes (top winds of 74 mph or greater), including seven major hurricanes (top winds of 111 mph or greater). This is the most storms on record, surpassing the 28 from 2005, and the secondhighest number of hurricanes on record. On 3 November 2020, Hurricane Eta made landfall in Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane, causing landslides and floods that displaced thousands of people and left dozens dead or missing in Central America and parts of the Caribbean. The extreme rainfall associated with Eta2 caused catastrophic flash flooding, river flooding, and deadly landslides across the region. Flooding or landslides contributed to at least 74 deaths in Honduras, 60 in Guatemala, 27 in Mexico, and 2 in both Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Fortunately, there was no reported loss of life near the landfall location on the coast of north-eastern Nicaragua, although Eta caused very severe damage in that area. The United Nations (UN) estimated that 4.9 million people were adversely impacted by the torrential rainfall, strong winds, and storm surge produced by Eta. There was an estimated $6.8 billion (USD) worth of total damage from Eta in Central America, according to the Global Catastrophe Recap produced by Aon. Unfortunately, this devastation was soon to be followed by additional disastrous impacts from Hurricane Iota just two weeks later. Hurricane Iota worsened the situation in areas already affected by Eta and significantly expanded the impact to other regions in Nicaragua and other Central American countries. Hurricane Iota3 made landfall with an intensity of 125 kt around 0340 UTC 17 November along the eastern coast of Nicaragua about 20 mi south-south-west of Puerto Cabezas near the village of Haulover. Shortly after landfall, Iota turned due west and rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Nicaragua, becoming a tropical storm by 1800 UTC that day while located over western Nicaragua near the Honduras-Nicaragua border. Further weakening followed as the cyclone moved across the rugged terrain of southern Honduras early on 18 November and become a tropical depression by 1200 UTC 18 November when the broad system was moving across east-central El Salvador. Iota dissipated over western El Salvador 6 hours later. These two hurricanes affected more than 7.5 million people in Central America4. The governments of Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua declared states of emergency in at-risk departments and requested humanitarian and financial aid, elevating it to an official international-level request to intensify emergency response actions. According to the CEPAL report \"Evaluation of the effects and impacts of tropical depressions Eta and Iota in Guatemala\"5, these two hurricanes caused flooding and dozens of catastrophic mudslides and mudflows. The National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED by its Spanish acronym) reported that 16 of 22 departments were affected by both events, with damage concentrated in Alta Verapaz, Izabal, Quiché, Huehuetenango, Petén, Zacapa and Chiquimula, where around 5 million people live. In the departments of Izabal, Petén, Alta Verapaz and Quiché, an area of approximately 530 km2 was flooded, where some 33,000 people were directly exposed. The landslides occurred along a wide swath of the mountainous zone of Huehuetenango, Quiché and Alta Verapaz, as well as in steeply sloping areas of Chiquimula. Data from CONRED's Emergency or Disaster Information Management System (SISMICEDE by its Spanish acronym) showed some 425 landslides and mudflows.

 ["In May 2022, Lebanon held its first general elections since 2018. These elections took place against the backdrop of a severe complex humanitarian crisis and periods of civil unrest surrounding governance issues. Since 2011, Lebanon has hosted the largest number of refugees per capita in the world, including Syrians displaced by conflict in addition to hosting a substantial number of Palestinian refugees. Since the end of 2019, Lebanon has witnessed civil unrest, economic instability, currency devaluation, a pandemic, and a massive explosion in the heart of its capital. Since September 2019, Lebanon’s socioeconomic collapse has spiraled into one of the top three most severe economic crises the world has seen since the 1850s, according to the World Bank. Over 80% of people in Lebanon are living in multidimensional poverty, which reflects deprivation across areas including healthcare, electricity, water, sanitation, transportation, connectivity, and means of income. In August 2020, a double explosion at the port of Beirut, caused by the detonation of hundreds of tons of highly explosive fertilizer, took over 200 lives, left over 6,000 people with physical injuries and others with psychological distress, and displaced over 300,000 people. The elections took place as scheduled on 15 May 2022. While voting passed mostly peacefully, a number of disputes and violent incidents occurred on election day including a reported clash between supporters of different political parties. Following the announcement of the results, several people including at least four children were injured by celebratory gunfire. There have been protests related to the conduct and results of elections, as well as in connection to the ongoing economic crisis. Lebanon’s currency lost value after the elections, selling for around 27,000 lira to the dollar on the parallel market on 15 May to a low of nearly 37,000 lira to the dollar on 27 May before climbing again to the pre-election rate. It continued to fluctuate throughout the summer. In an indicator of growing desperation related to the economic situation, there were a series of bank holdups in the fall of 2022 in which mostly small depositors held up bank locations to gain access to their own savings which banks have largely blocked from withdrawal since the onset of the economic crisis. Negotiations over the formation of a new government extended beyond the period of this DREF operation. Lebanon’s parliament failed to agree on the election of a new president before the expiration of President Michel Aoun’s term on 31 October. Extended delays in the formation of a government expose Lebanon to a constitutional crisis with the risk of disputes between political actors, protest activity, and unrest. A vacuum in the presidency also forestalls a final deal with the International Monetary Fund, which is viewed as a critical step toward resolving the country’s economic crisis.\r",{"entities":[[169,181,"DISASTER"],[454,466,"DISASTER"],[468,488,"DISASTER"],[490,510,"DISASTER"],[514,522,"DISASTER"],[530,547,"DISASTER"],[825,832,"DISASTER"],[849,978,"DISASTER"],[997,1025,"DISASTER"],[1029,1035,"ADMIN_1"],[1361,1391,"DISASTER"],[1438,1494,"DISASTER"],[1577,1622,"DISASTER"],[1754,1783,"DISASTER"],[2698,2731,"DISASTER"],[2733,2749,"DISASTER"],[2755,2762,"DISASTER"]]}],
 ["This DREF was triggered by the new and worsened humanitarian needs in Syria caused by water shortages and severe drought conditions, the worst in 70 years in 2020/2021. The lack of water and the drought situation contributed to the deterioration of living standards, coupled with increasing costs of food, water, and basic goods due to the massive devaluation of the local currency whilst the income and purchasing power of people have been shrinking. Low and erratic rainfall during the 2020/2021 winter season, accompanied by higher-than-average temperatures, led to drought conditions in Northern and North-East Syria, as well as in other parts of Syria, with significant crop and livestock production losses. Syria witnessed unprecedented low water levels of the Euphrates River, and record low levels of water in reservoirs resulted in reduced energy production capacity causing power blackouts across north-eastern Syria affecting more than three million people. The combined effect of reduced water levels in the Euphrates river and drought conditions impacted the food and nutrition security of households dependent on agriculture in Ar-Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor. Significant shortages and high cost of agriculture inputs, including diesel fuel, limited the cultivated area and ability to provide supplementary irrigation for cultivated crops. The water scarcity and high prices of fuel make irrigation out of reach for many households, and the lack of pasture and high price of feed for animals has resulted in the destocking of weaker animals. Particularly in the northeast Al-Hasakeh, the breadbasket of the country, a reduction in both rainfall and river water for irrigation caused substantial harvest loss for the main crops, with wheat production at the lowest levels in almost 50 years1. For livestock, the production of fodder crops was adversely affected, and high fodder prices in combination with lack of access to grazing areas resulted in destocking, while animal prices dropped by at least 20 - 30 per cent. Due to the unavailability of clean water, households are increasingly consuming unsafe water, and with an increasing number of water-borne diseases, the public health system faces additional strain, which is exacerbated by the COVID-19 situation. In the North East of Syria (NES), the number of acute diarrhoea cases increased by 25% between January and June 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020. The reduction in safe and sufficient water is affecting hygiene and other preventative measures. As the drought-like conditions and economic crisis persist, the capacity of vulnerable farming households and small-scale livestock keepers to generate income and access food continues to erode. Harmful coping mechanisms increased with households taking on more debt.",{"entities":[[86,101,"DISASTER"],[106,131,"DISASTER"],[173,186,"DISASTER"],[195,212,"DISASTER"],[232,328,"DISASTER"],[348,381,"DISASTER"],[460,476,"DISASTER"],[569,587,"DISASTER"],[675,712,"DISASTER"],[743,759,"DISASTER"],[795,814,"DISASTER"],[841,899,"DISASTER"],[992,1012,"DISASTER"],[1040,1047,"DISASTER"],[1059,1099,"DISASTER"],[1352,1390,"DISASTER"],[1626,1668,"DISASTER"],[1703,1728,"DISASTER"],[1957,1967,"DISASTER"],[2069,2119,"DISASTER"],[2133,2174,"DISASTER"],[2322,2360,"DISASTER"],[2537,2560,"DISASTER"],[2565,2580,"DISASTER"]]}],
